# Data Harmonization Pipeline - SparkR branch

This branch has all the SparkR code I have writtenh, in folder```sparkr_code```.
* I have been learning different SparkR stuff on test datasets on a bunch of Jupyter notebooks. A lot of things I learnt are based off [this](https://github.com/jadianes/spark-r-notebooks) resource, and from [the official documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html).
* ```sparkr_code``` - adapting the package's code into SparkR. Since implementation is buggy, I am working with Jupyter notebooks to be able to resolve bugs quickly (as opposed to using RStudio right now - I find Jupyter notebooks easier to debug with). Once my prototype is bug-free and works substantially well, I'll port it over to RStudio.
    * Files have a few notes on the top noting important changes I made, and things to look into.
